# Coffee Project - Grind setting to grain size

Data and code sharing of coffee grain size analyses

Some initial results:

The grind settings used appear to be linear spaced. Also we see from the different size parameters that coffee is not spherical!

The same grind setting using different beans appears to produce a slightly different grain size distribution.
